## ⚙️ How it works

- The plugin don't replace the image, but only add an additional image fill.

- You can remove all Cage images by one button.

- You can remove all cell images even if you closed the plugin. All images with hash IDs will be associated with the plugin until you delete them. Hash IDs will be created for each page where you run the plugin.
